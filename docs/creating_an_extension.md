# Creating an extension

Create an extension with no build configuration. 

Once you have [set up your development environment](development_environment.md), you can use the [Sourcegraph extension generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sourcegraph/create-extension) to setup your extension.

Create a directory for your extension, then run the generator. 

```shell
# npm
npm init @sourcegraph/extension
``` 

Checkout the `package.json` for npm commands you can run.
